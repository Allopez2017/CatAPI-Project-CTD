<h3>Quick Cat Facts</h3>
<div id="cat-fact-container">
<p class="cat-fact">
  Known as Felis catus in Latin, the domestic house cat is said to have been first domesticated 
  around 7500 BC. Cats are small carnivorous mammals that have remarkable hunting qualities inherited
  from their Big cat ancestors. These cute, cuddly creatures not only have sharp, retractable claws, but
  they also have night vision which helps them locate and catch prey.
</p>
<p class="cat-fact">
  While you might be familiar with a cat's 'Meow,' kitties actually have multiple different sounds they omit
  including: trilling, hissing, growling, and purring. Some believe kitties evolved to 'Meow' due to their domestication
  as a way to communicate with their human owners. Trilling is linked to a cat's hunting instinct. They often trill to imitate
  a bird call so their prey will let their guard down for them to hunt.
